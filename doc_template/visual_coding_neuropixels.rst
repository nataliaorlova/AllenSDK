Visual Coding Neuropixels
=========================

The Visual Coding Neuropixels project uses high-density extracellular electrophysiological (Ecephys) probes to record visually-evoked 
responses simultaneously from neurons located in the visual cortex and subcortical regions of the mouse. Spike-sorted data and metadata are available 
via the AllenSDK as `Neurodata Without Borders <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ files.


Getting Started
---------------
To jump right in, check out the `quick start guide <_static/examples/nb/ecephys_quickstart.html>`_ `(download .ipynb) <_static/examples/nb/ecephys_quickstart.ipynb>`_, 
which covers downloading data, building peristimulus time histograms, and decoding images. If you would like more example code, 
see the `full example notebook <_static/examples/nb/ecephys_session.html>`_ `(download .ipynb) <_static/examples/nb/ecephys_session.ipynb>`_.

The experimental design, data acquisition, and informatics methods are described in the technical whitepaper. AllenSDK 
API documentation `is available here <allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.html>`_.
