Optotagging table
=================

Compiles a table of information about the optotagging stimulation on this experiment. This table has the following columns:
- Start: the onset time (global clock) of optical stimulation
- condition: integer identifier for the optical stimulation pattern
- level: intensity (in volts output to the LED) of stimulation

The conditions are:
- 0 = 2.5 ms pulses at 10 Hz for 1 s
- 1 = 5 ms pulse
- 2 = 10 ms pulse
- 3 = 1 s raised cosine pulse

See the example gallery for a plot of the conditions.


Input data
----------
- Optotagging pickle : a pickled Python dictionary containing 4 keys:
    1. opto_conditions: The condition labels described above
    2. opto_levels: The light levels described above
    3. opto_waveforms: templates showing the signal associated with each condition
    4. opto_ISIs: inter-stimulus-intervals. These are drawn from the software controller without accounting for hardware delays, so they are slightly (but consistently) shorter than the gap between adjacent LED times.
- Sync file : an h5 file containging information about timing on this experiment's global clock. We are mainly interested in the LED times, which define the onsets of optical stimulation.


Output data
-----------
- optotagging table : a csv containing optical stimulation times, conditions, and levels
